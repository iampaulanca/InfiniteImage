=====================================================================================================================
http://localhost:3000/users can now add users and some data

TO CREATE YOUR DATABASE LOCALLY ON MYSQL WITH MY SAME EXACT SETTINGS
Database instruction for our project:
create database ii_development
create user 'iiadmin'@'localhost' identified by 'team06'
grant all on iidevelopment to ‘iiadmin’@‘localhost’

YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME DATA I HAVE ON MY LOCAL MACHINE BUT YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME SCHEMA
AT THE MOMENT WE DONT HAVE ANYTHING IMPORTANT LOCALLY ANYWAYS 
LOOKUP UP COMMANDS rake db:schema:load, rake db:create, AND rake db:migrate THESE WILL HELP WITH TESTING
